Google Places:
Using an array of Place.Fields, you can limit the response to only those fields specified. 
Fields in the Basic category are included in the base cost of the Places request, and do 
not result in any additional charge. The Basic Data SKU is triggered when any of these 
fields are requested: ADDRESS, ID, LAT_LNG, NAME, OPENING_HOURS, PHOTO_METADATAS, PLUS_CODE, 
TYPES, VIEWPORT.
